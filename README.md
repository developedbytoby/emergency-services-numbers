bored of constantly having to google and remember new emergency numbers every single time you visit a new country? well! this tiny utility is for you! âœ¨

## how does it work?
using middleware, the website determines which country you're in. once it's done this, it'll then set a cookie called `countryCode`, which has the value of an iso 3166-1 alpha-2 code that belongs to the country you're currently located in!

after this, it then fetches the emergency numbers, and country name from the [emergency number api](https://emergencynumberapi.com/), and displays this data to the user!
